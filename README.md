SpiNNaker Network Tester
========================

A simple test programme for SpiNNaker machines which drives the network with
dummy traffic. This programme is intended to be used to test the performance of
the results of [Rig](https://github.com/project-rig/rig) library's place and
route tools.


Overview
--------

At a high level, the input to this tool is a hypergraph of 'traffic nodes' which
produce streams of packets according to some temporal distribution. Several
'traffic nodes' may be combined onto a single 'network node' (i.e. SpiNNaker core)
and these are mapped onto physical SpiNNaker cores and appropriate routes are
generated by rig.

The SpiNNaker system executes a simple executable which produces patterns
according to the input specification while recording system data during the
runtime of the execution.
